I created a radar chart for every pitcher’s pitch type. On the radar chart it has 7 metrics which is the average of release spin axis, release speed, release spin rate, trajectory of horizontal and vertical break, and trajectory of vertical and horizontal approach angle. On the radar chart if the player has played in both games it will have two line for the two different game. 	


Findings
  
  •	Player’s that played in both games, seems to have very identical performance. They did not get effect by fatigue, even a lot of metrics are better in the second game
 
  •	The faster the fastball the lower the trajectory of horizontal approach angle, but with higher spin axis, it will result to higher trajectory of horizontal approach   angle
 
  •	Most of curve ball radar chart is very similar. It has low release spin axis, other than pitcher 11’s curve ball. He has a really high spin axis

  •	A lot of pitcher’s trajectory horizontal break of slider is very low. Just a little amount pitcher that has high horizontal break on slider. It seems like changeup     is the pitch that can generates the most horizontal movement for all the pitchers
 
  •	Sinker is a very weird pitch. The vertical movement is very similar but the horizontal movement have a lot of difference. Meaning that the way the pitcher approach     sinker is very different. 

  •	Cutter is a very interesting pitch as well. My knowledge on cutter is that it will generate more horizontal movement then vertical movement. But that doesn’t seem to   be the case in these two games
